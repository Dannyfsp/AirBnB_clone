A readme on the Client side (front-end) of the AirBnB clone project.

During this project we learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS language. HTML is the structure of the page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of the page, the design. We are encouraged to fix the HTML part before starting the styling. Inded, without any structure, you can't apply any design.
